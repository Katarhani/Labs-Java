Oh, in a blink, gone
Blink, gone, can't miss it
Blink and gone

The clock goes tick-tock, tick-tock
Just enjoy it, blink, gone
Oh, in a blink, gone
(Let's go)

Today, this moment will never come again
The party begins, let's go crazy, high
Wave your hands, let your body go with the rhythm
This music on and on

The blue lights
Tickle my eyes, and I smile
Before this bright moment fades away

Oh, in a blink, gone, forget everything and enjoy
Oh, in a blink, gone, don't miss this moment
I'm tellin' you, blink, gone, don't leave any regrets
The clock goes tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Blink, gone

Oh, in a blink, gone
Blink and gone, savor it now
In a blink, gone

Empty your mind, no need for baggage
Own the party, no, don't look back now
For me, there's no yesterday or tomorrow
It's this moment or nothing

The dark red air
Wraps around us, lifting our spirits
This hot thrill spreads to the end of the sky

Oh, in a blink, gone, forget everything and enjoy
Oh, in a blink, gone, don't miss this moment
I'm tellin' you, blink, gone, don't leave any regrets
The clock goes tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Blink, gone

(Oh, in a blink, gone, forget everything and enjoy)
(Oh, in a blink, gone, don't miss this moment)
(I'm tellin' you, blink, gone, don't leave any regrets)
(The clock goes tick-tock, tick-tock)

Oh, in a blink, gone, forget everything and enjoy
Oh, in a blink, gone, don't miss this moment
I'm tellin' you, blink, gone, don't leave any regrets
The clock goes tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Blink, gone
